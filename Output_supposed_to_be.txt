This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [see Contraindications (4)]. 1.1 Oral ContraceptiveSprintec® (norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy [see Clinical Studies(14)]. 2.1 How To Start SprintecSprintec is dispensed in a blister pack tablet dispenser [see HowSupplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. Sprintec may be started using either a Day 1 start or a Sunday start (see Table 1). For the first cycle of a Sunday Start regimen, an additional method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration. 2.2 How To Take SprintecTable 1:  Instructions for Administration of SprintecStarting COCs in women not currently using hormonal contraception (Day 1 Start or Sunday Start) Important: Consider the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of this product. Tablet Color:  •Sprintec active tablets are blue (Day 1 to Day 21).  •Sprintec has white inactive tablets (Day 22 to Day 28).Day 1 Start: •Take first active tablet without regard to meals on the first day of menses.  •Take subsequent active tablets once daily at the same time each day for a total of 21 days.  •Take one white inactive tablet daily for 7 days and at the same time of day that active tablets were taken.  •Begin each subsequent pack on the same day of the week as the first cycle pack (i.e., on the day after taking the last inactive tablet)Sunday Start:  •Take first active tablet without regard to meals on the first Sunday after the onset of menses. Due to the potential risk of becoming pregnant, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of the patient’s first cycle pack of Sprintec.  •Take subsequent active tablets once daily at the same time each day for a total of 21 days.  •Take one white inactive tablet daily for the following 7 days and at the same time of day that active tablets were taken.  •Begin each subsequent pack on the same day of the week as the first cycle pack (i.e., on the Sunday after taking the last inactive tablet) and additional non-hormonal contraceptive is not needed.Switching to Sprintec from another oral contraceptiveStart on the same day that a new pack of the previous oral contraceptive would have started.Switching from another contraceptive method to SprintecStart Sprintec: •Transdermal patch •On the day when next application would have been scheduled •Vaginal ring •On the day when next insertion would have been scheduled •Injection •On the day when next injection would have been scheduled •Intrauterine contraceptive •On the day of removal  •If the IUD is not removed on first day of the patient’s menstrual cycle, additional non-hormonal contraceptive (such as condoms and spermicide) is needed for the first seven days of the first cycle pack. •Implant •On the day of removalComplete instructions to facilitate patient counseling on proper tablet usage are located in the FDA-Approved Patient Labeling.Starting Sprintec after Abortion or MiscarriageFirst-trimester  •After a first-trimester abortion or miscarriage, Sprintec may be started immediately. An additional method of contraception is not needed if Sprintec is started immediately. •If Sprintec is not started within 5 days after termination of the pregnancy, the patient should use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of her first cycle pack of Sprintec.Second-trimester  •Do not start until 4 weeks after a second-trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start Sprintec, following the instructions in Table 1 for Day 1 or Sunday start, as desired. If using Sunday start, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) for the first seven days of the patient’s first cycle pack of Sprintec. [See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling.]Starting Sprintec after Childbirth  •Do not start until 4 weeks after delivery, due to the increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Start contraceptive therapy with Sprintec following the instructions in Table 1 for women not currently using hormonal contraception. •Sprintec is not recommended for use in lactating women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. •If the woman has not yet had a period postpartum, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to use of Sprintec.  [See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3), and FDA-Approved Patient Labeling].There are two ways to start taking birth-control pills, Sunday Start or Day 1 Start.  Your healthcare professional will tell you which to use.How to Use Blister Cards for the 28 Tablets1.Pick the Days of the Week Sticker that starts the first day of your period. (This is the day you begin bleeding or spotting, even if it is midnight when bleeding begins.) When you have picked the right sticker, throw away the others and place the sticker on the blister card over the pre-printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills.2.Your blister package consists of three parts, the foil pouch, wallet, and a blister pack containing 28 individually sealed pills.  Note that the pills are arranged in four numbered rows of 7 pills, with the pre-printed days of the week printed above them. All 21 blue pills are “active” birth-control pills, and 7 white “reminder” pills. Refer to the sample of the blister card below:3.After taking the last white pill, start a new blister card the very next day no matter when your period started. You will be taking a pill every day without interruption. Any time you start the pills later than directed, protect yourself by using another method of birth control until you have taken a pill a day for seven consecutive days.  After taking the last white pill, start taking the first blue pill from the blister card the very next day.4.Take the pills in each new package as before. Start with the blue pill on row #1 and take one pill each day, left to right, until the last white pill has been taken.Three Ways to Remember in What Order to Take the Pills1.Follow the sticker with the days of the week (placed above the pills).2.Always go from left to right.3.Always finish all your blue pills.2.3 Missed TabletsTable 2:  Instructions for Missed Sprintec Tablets •If one active tablet is missed in Weeks 1, 2, or 3Take the tablet as soon as possible. Continue taking one tablet a day until the pack is finished. •If two active tablets are missed in Week 1 or Week 2Take the two missed tablets as soon as possible and the next two active tablets the next day. Continue taking one tablet a day until the pack is finished. Additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) should be used as back-up if the patient has sex within 7 days after missing tablets. •If two active tablets are missed in the third week or three or more active tablets are missed in a row in Weeks 1, 2, or 3Day 1 start: Throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day.Sunday start: Continue taking one tablet a day until Sunday, then throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. Additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms and spermicide) should be used as back-up if the patient has sex within 7 days after missing tablets.2.4 Advice In Case Of Gastrointestinal DisturbancesIn case of severe vomiting or diarrhea, absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. If vomiting or diarrhea occurs within 3 to 4 hours after taking an active tablet, handle this as a missed tablet [seeFDA-Approved Patient Labeling]. 3 Dosage Forms And StrengthsSprintec Tablets are available in blister cards. Each blister card contains 28 tablets in the following order:21 blue, round, flat-faced, beveled-edge, unscored tablet debossed with stylized b on one side and 987 on the other side contains 0.250 mg norgestimate and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol7 white, round, flat-faced, beveled-edge, unscored tablet (non-hormonal placebo) debossed with stylized b on one side and 143 on the other side contains inert ingredients 4 ContraindicationsDo not prescribe Sprintec to women who are known to have the following conditions: •A high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases. Examples include women who are known to:oSmoke, if over age 35 [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]oHave deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, now or in the past [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]oHave inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]oHave cerebrovascular disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]oHave coronary artery disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]oHave thrombogenic valvular or thrombogenic rhythm diseases of the heart (for example, subacute bacterial endocarditis with valvular disease, or atrial fibrillation) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]oHave uncontrolled hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]oHave diabetes mellitus with vascular disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]oHave headaches with focal neurological symptoms or migraine headaches with aura [see Warnings andPrecautions (5.6)]▪Women over age 35 with any migraine headaches [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] •Liver tumors, benign or malignant, or liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] •Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] •Pregnancy, because there is no reason to use COCs during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Use inSpecific Populations (8.1)] •Breast cancer or other estrogen-or progestin-sensitive cancer, now or in the past [see Warnings and Precautions(5.10)]5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders And Other Vascular Problems•Stop Sprintec if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. •Stop Sprintec if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. •If feasible, stop Sprintec at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. •Start Sprintec no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. •The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. •Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. •Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.5.2 Liver DiseaseImpaired Liver FunctionDo not use Sprintec in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Sprintec if jaundice develops.Liver TumorsSprintec is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 High Blood PressureSprintec is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [seeContraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Sprintec if blood pressure rises significantly.An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.4 Gallbladder DiseaseStudies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.5 Carbohydrate And Lipid Metabolic EffectsCarefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Sprintec. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.6 HeadacheIf a woman taking Sprintec develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Sprintec if indicated.Consider discontinuation of Sprintec in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.7 Bleeding Irregularities And AmenorrheaUnscheduled Bleeding and SpottingUnscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.In clinical trials of Sprintec, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles). A total of 100 (7.5%) women discontinued Sprintec, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 14 to 34% of women using Sprintec experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.Amenorrhea and OligomenorrheaWomen who use Sprintec may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.8 Coc Use Before Or During Early PregnancyExtensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Sprintec use if pregnancy is confirmed.Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in SpecificPopulations (8.1)]. 5.9 DepressionCarefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Sprintec if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Carcinoma Of Breast And Cervix•Sprintec is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)].There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings. •Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.5.11 Effect On Binding GlobulinsThe estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 MonitoringA woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary AngioedemaIn women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 ChloasmaChloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Sprintec. 6 Adverse ReactionsThe following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: •Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Vascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] •Liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are: •Irregular uterine bleeding •Nausea •Breast tenderness •Headache6.1 Clinical Trial ExperienceBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.The safety of Sprintec was evaluated in 1,647 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 3 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of Sprintec for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 1 was an uncontrolled open-label trial. In all 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles.Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects): The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,647 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (32.9%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (7.8%), vaginal infection (8.4%), genital discharge (6.8%), breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement) (6.3%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (5%), flatulence (3.2%), nervousness (2.9%), and rash (2.6%).Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation: Over the three trials, between 11 to 21% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (6.9%), nausea/vomiting (5%), headache (4.1%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (2.4%), premenstrual syndrome (1.7%), hypertension (1.4%), breast pain (1.4%), nervousness (1.3%), amenorrhea (1.1%), dysmenorrhea (1.1%), weight increased (1.1%), and flatulence (1.1%).Serious Adverse Reactions: breast cancer (1 subject), mood disorders including depression, irritability, and mood swings (1 subject), myocardial infarction (1 subject), and venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (1 subject) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1 subject). 6.2 Postmarketing ExperienceThe following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.Infections and Infestations: Urinary tract infection;Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl. Cysts and Polyps): Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst;Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity;Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dyslipidemia;Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia;Nervous System Disorders: Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness;Eye Disorders: Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance;Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo;Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations;Vascular Events: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush;Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident;Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea;Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation;Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis;Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne;Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders: Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain;Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness;General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, asthenic conditions. 7 Drug InteractionsConsult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Sprintec. 7.1 Effects Of Other Drugs On Combined Oral ContraceptivesSubstances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs:Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John’s wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.Colesevelam: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart.Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs:Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). 7.2 Effects Of Combined Oral Contraceptives On Other Drugs•COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. •COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs.7.3 Interference With Laboratory TestsThe use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. 8.1 PregnancyThere is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy. Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion. 8.3 Nursing MothersAdvise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception, when possible, until she has weaned her child. COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk. 8.4 Pediatric UseSafety and efficacy of Sprintec Tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated. 8.5 Geriatric UseSprintec has not been studied in postmenopausal women and are not indicated in this population. 8.6 Hepatic ImpairmentThe pharmacokinetics of Sprintec have not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] 8.7 Renal ImpairmentThe pharmacokinetics of Sprintec have not been studied in women with renal impairment. 10 OverdosageThere have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdosage of oral contraceptives, including ingestion by children. Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea. 11 DescriptionSprintec® (norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) is a combination oral contraceptive containing the progestational compound norgestimate, USP and the estrogenic compound ethinyl estradiol, USP.Each blue tablet contains 0.250 mg of the progestational compound norgestimate (18, 19-Dinor-17-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one,17-(acetyloxy)-13-ethyl-, oxime, (17α)-(+)-) and 0.035 mg of the estrogenic compound, ethinyl estradiol (19-nor-17α-pregna, 1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3, 17-diol), and the inactive ingredients include anhydrous lactose, FD&C blue no. 2 aluminum lake, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, and pregelatinized corn starch.Each white tablet contains only inert ingredients as follows: anhydrous lactose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2208, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose.The structural formula is as follows:                                                              C23H31NO3M.W. 369.50                                                          C20H24O2 M.W. 296.4012.1 Mechanism Of Action•Oral ContraceptionCOCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation. •AcneAcne is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology, including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate increases sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in the severity of facial acne in otherwise healthy women with this skin condition has not been established.12.2 PharmacodynamicsNo specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Sprintec. 12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorptionNorgestimate (NGM) and EE are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. NGM is rapidly and completely metabolized by first pass (intestinal and/or hepatic) mechanisms to norelgestromin (NGMN) and norgestrel (NG), which are the major active metabolites of norgestimate.Peak serum concentrations of NGMN and EE are generally reached by 2 hours after administration of Sprintec. Accumulation following multiple dosing of the 250 mcg NGM / 35 mcg EE dose is approximately 2-fold for NGMN and EE compared with single dose administration. The pharmacokinetics of NGMN is dose-proportional following NGM doses of 180 mcg to 250 mcg. Steady-state concentration of EE is achieved by Day 7 of each dosing cycle. Steady-state concentrations of NGMN and NG are achieved by Day 21. Non-linear accumulation (approximately 8 fold) of NG is observed as a result of high-affinity binding to SHBG, which limits its biological activity (Table 3).Table 3:  Summary of NGMN, NG and EE pharmacokinetic parameters.Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Sprintec During a Three Cycle StudyAnalyteCycleDayCmaxtmax (h)AUC0-24ht1/2 (h)NGMN111.78 (0.397)1.19 (0.25)9.9 (3.25)18.4 (5.91)3212.19 (0.655)1.43 (0.68)18.1 (5.53)24.9 (9.04)NG110.649 (0.49)1.42 (0.69)6.22 (2.46)37.8 (14)3212.65 (1.11)1.67 (1.32)48.2 (20.5)45 (20.4)EE1192.2 (24.5)1.2 (0.26)629 (138)10.1 (1.90)321147 (41.5)1.13 (0.23)1210 (294)15 (2.36)Cmax = peak serum concentration, tmax = time to reach peak serum concentration, AUC0-24h = area under serum concentration vs time curve from 0 to 24 hours, t1/2 = elimination half-life, NC = not calculated.NGMN and NG: Cmax = ng/mL, AUC0-24h = h•ng/mLEE: Cmax = pg/mL, AUC0-24h = h•pg/mLFood EffectThe effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of Sprintec has not been studied.DistributionNGMN and NG are highly bound (>97%) to serum proteins. NGMN is bound to albumin and not to SHBG, while NG is bound primarily to SHBG. EE is extensively bound (>97%) to serum albumin and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of SHBG.MetabolismNGM is extensively metabolized by first-pass mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract and/or liver. NGM’s primary active metabolite is NGMN. Subsequent hepatic metabolism of NGMN occurs and metabolites include NG, which is also active, and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites. Although NGMN and its metabolites inhibit a variety of P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes, under the recommended dosing regimen, the in vivo concentrations of NGMN and its metabolites, even at the peak serum levels, are relatively low compared to the inhibitory constant (Ki). EE is also metabolized to various hydroxylated products and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.ExcretionThe metabolites of NGMN and EE are eliminated by renal and fecal pathways. Following administration of 14C-norgestimate, 47% (45 to 49%) and 37% (16 to 49%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and feces, respectively. Unchanged NGM was not detected in the urine. In addition to 17-deacetyl norgestimate, a number of metabolites of NGM have been identified in human urine following administration of radiolabeled NGM. These include 18, 19-Dinor-17-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one,17-hydroxy-13-ethyl,(17α)-(-);18,19-Dinor-5β17-pregnan-20-yn,3α,17β-dihydroxy-13-ethyl,(17α), various hydroxylated metabolites and conjugates of these metabolites. 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility[See Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.10) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1).] 14.1 ContraceptionIn three US clinical trials with Sprintec, 1,651 women aged 18 to 38 years were studied for up to 24 cycles, proving a total of 24,272 cycles of exposure.

The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant.Based on the results of clinical studies, about 1 out of 100 women may get pregnant during the first year they use Sprintec.The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control.

However, if you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use birth control pills because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones. Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners. What if I want to become pregnant?You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill. What should I know about my period when taking Sprintec? Your periods may be lighter and shorter than usual. Some women may miss a period. Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may happen while you are taking Sprintec, especially during the first few months of use. This usually is not a serious problem. It is important to continue taking your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy. What are the ingredients in Sprintec?  Active ingredients: Each blue pill contains norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol. Inactive ingredients: Blue pills: anhydrous lactose, FD&C blue no. 2 aluminum lake, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, and pregelatinized corn starch. White pills: anhydrous lactose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2208, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose. Instructions For UseSprintec® [sprin-tek](norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP)  Important Information about taking Sprintec •Take 1 pill every day at the same time. Take the pills in the order directed on your tablet dispenser. •Do not skip your pills, even if you do not have sex often. If you miss pills (including starting the pack late) you could get pregnant. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. •If you have trouble remembering to take Sprintec, talk to your healthcare provider. When you first start taking Sprintec, spotting or light bleeding in between your periods may occur. Contact your healthcare provider if this does not go away after a few months. •You may feel sick to your stomach (nauseous), especially during the first few months of taking Sprintec. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away.
